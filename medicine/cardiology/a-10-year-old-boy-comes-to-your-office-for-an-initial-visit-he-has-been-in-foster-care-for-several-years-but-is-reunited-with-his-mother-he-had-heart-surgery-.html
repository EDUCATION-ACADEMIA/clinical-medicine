<meta name="description" content="Help your body heal properly: Eating a heart-healthy diet, being active, reducing your stress, getting enough sleep and avoiding smoking are all important lifestyle choices that will help you heal and get back to your daily routine.You should have someone stay with you in your home for at least the first 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. Learn how to check your pulse, and check it every day. Do the breathing exercises you learned in the hospital for 4 to 6 weeks. Shower every day, washing the incision gently with soap and water.Most children who have open-heart surgery need to stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 2 to 4 days right after surgery. They most often stay in the hospital for 5 to 7 more days after they leave the ICU. Stays in the intensive care unit and the hospital are often shorter for people who have closed-heart surgery.How can I help? What are you feeling right now? Itll be okay. Ill be waiting for you after surgery! Can I give you a hug? I Love You 25-Aug-2019 ">
